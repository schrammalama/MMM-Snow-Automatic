# MMM-Snow
This is a version of MichMich's MMM-Snow but it is automated to start when it starts snowing.
You need MMM-Remote-Control https://github.com/Jopyth/MMM-Remote-Control
and a OpenWeatherMap api key, it is free but you need an account. https://openweathermap.org/
to configure go into the MMM-Snow.js file and place in your api key, city id and ip address for MMM-Remote-Control

This is a WIP and any feedback is appreciated.
